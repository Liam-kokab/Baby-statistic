# Process Management (PM2)

Production runs under [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a Node.js process manager. PM2 keeps the server, MCP server, and a health-check watchdog alive, automatically restarting any of them on crash.

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ecosystem.config.js` | PM2 app definitions (root of repo) |
| `healthcheck.js` | Watchdog process — pings `/api/ping` on an interval and restarts the server via the PM2 API after repeated failures |

## Managed Processes
| Name | Script | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `baby-statistic-server` | `dist/index.js` | Express API + static client, port `80` |
| `baby-statistic-mcp` | `dist/mcp-server/index.js` | MCP server (SSE), port `3001` |
| `baby-statistic-healthcheck` | `healthcheck.js` | Watchdog — see below |

All three apps have `autorestart: true`, `max_restarts: 10`, `min_uptime: '10s'`, and `exp_backoff_restart_delay` so a crash-looping process backs off instead of hammering restarts. This is PM2's built-in **crash restart** behaviour — no extra code needed for it.

Each app also declares an explicit `out_file` / `error_file` (under `logs/` at the repo root, gitignored) plus `merge_logs: true` and `time: true`. This guarantees each app's stdout/stderr goes to its own dedicated, timestamped file — `pm2 logs <name>` reads from these directly, so if one app's log looks empty it's genuinely producing no output (see Troubleshooting below), not a log-routing artifact.

## Health Check & Auto-Restart
`healthcheck.js` runs as its own PM2 process. Every `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (default `30000`) it sends a `GET` to `HEALTHCHECK_URL` (default `http://localhost:80/api/ping`, the existing `server/src/routes/ping.ts` endpoint). If the request fails or doesn't return `2xx` for `HEALTHCHECK_MAX_FAILURES` consecutive checks (default `3`), it calls the PM2 API (`pm2.restart('baby-statistic-server')`) to force a restart — this catches cases where the process is alive but unresponsive (e.g. deadlocked), which a crash-only restart wouldn't catch.

To avoid false positives around startup/restart timing, checks are skipped entirely during a **grace period** (`HEALTHCHECK_GRACE_MS`, default `20000`) right after the healthcheck process itself starts, and again immediately after it triggers a restart — this gives the target process (migrations, admin seed, etc.) time to actually finish booting before being judged unhealthy.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HEALTHCHECK_URL` | `http://localhost:80/api/ping` | Endpoint polled for health |
| `HEALTHCHECK_TARGET` | `baby-statistic-server` | PM2 app name to restart when unhealthy |
| `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | `30000` | Poll interval |
| `HEALTHCHECK_MAX_FAILURES` | `3` | Consecutive failures before restarting |
| `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Per-request timeout before counting as a failure |
| `HEALTHCHECK_GRACE_MS` | `300000` | Checks are skipped for this long after process start and after each triggered restart |

The production defaults in `ecosystem.config.js` are tuned for weaker production hardware, where migrations + admin seed + first `listen()` can take much longer than on a dev machine — hence the 5 min grace period (up from a 20s default) and 15s per-request timeout, so the healthcheck doesn't restart a server that simply hasn't finished booting yet.

## Starting / Restarting Everything
```bash
npm run build      # compile client + server + mcp-server → dist/
npm start          # build + pm2 start ecosystem.config.js (all 3 apps)
npm run restart    # pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env
npm run stop       # pm2 stop ecosystem.config.js
```

Other useful scripts:
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run pm2:start` | `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` (no rebuild) |
| `npm run pm2:restart` | Restart all managed apps, picking up new env vars |
| `npm run pm2:stop` | Stop all managed apps (keeps them registered in PM2) |
| `npm run pm2:delete` | Remove all managed apps from PM2 |
| `npm run pm2:status` | `pm2 status` — list process states |
| `npm run pm2:logs` | `pm2 logs` — tail logs for all managed apps |

## Persisting Across Reboots (optional)
To have PM2 automatically start these apps after a machine reboot:
```bash
pm2 startup   # follow the printed instructions once
pm2 save      # after `npm start`, freeze the current process list
```

## Deploying Updates (`deploy.sh`)
`deploy.sh` (repo root) automates a full production update on the server machine:

```bash
./deploy.sh          # deploys the current branch
./deploy.sh main     # or deploy a specific branch
# equivalently:
npm run deploy
```

Steps performed:
1. `pm2 stop ecosystem.config.js` — stop the server, MCP server, and healthcheck
2. `git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` + `git clean -fd` — discard local changes and sync to the remote branch exactly (respects `.gitignore`, so `data/`, `.env`, `node_modules`, etc. are left untouched)
3. `npm install` — pick up any new/updated dependencies across all workspaces
4. `npm run build` — rebuild `client`, `server`, and `mcp-server` into `dist/`
5. `pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.config.js --update-env` + `pm2 save` — bring everything back up (works whether or not the apps were already registered with PM2) and persist the process list for reboot survival

### Other things to check before/after deploying
- **Database migrations** run automatically on server startup (`import './db'` in `server/src/index.ts`) — no manual migration step needed.
- **`.env` file**: not touched by `git clean`/`reset` since it's gitignored — make sure `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and any `SEED_ADMIN_*` vars are already set on the machine (see `doc/auth.md`).
- **Backups**: consider hitting `GET /api/backup` (admin only) before a risky deploy — see `doc/rest-api.md`.
- **`doc/openAPI.json`**: served at `/api-docs` directly from disk at server startup, so it's picked up automatically after `git reset` + restart — no extra step needed.

## Troubleshooting

### `curl: (7) Failed to connect ... port 80 after 0 ms`
An immediate connection refusal (not a timeout) means **nothing is listening on port 80**. Check what's happening:
```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs baby-statistic-server --lines 50 --nostream
```

**Most common cause**: on Linux/macOS, binding to any port below 1024 (like `80`) requires elevated privileges. If PM2 runs as a normal (non-root) user, `app.listen(80)` throws `EACCES: permission denied`, the app crashes on every start, and `autorestart` + `max_restarts: 10` exhausts its retries and gives up — leaving port 80 with nothing bound to it. Look for `Error: listen EACCES: permission denied 0.0.0.0:80` in the logs above.

Fixes (pick one):
1. **Grant Node the capability to bind low ports** (recommended — keeps PM2 running as a normal user):
   ```bash
   sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' $(readlink -f $(which node))
   pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env
   ```
   Must be re-run after upgrading the Node binary.
2. **Run on a high port behind a reverse proxy** — change `PORT` in `ecosystem.config.js` to e.g. `3000` and put nginx/Caddy in front on port 80.
3. **Run PM2 as root** — works but not recommended for production.

### Healthcheck keeps restarting a server that seems fine
This usually means the healthcheck is failing (and restarting the target) faster than the target can actually finish booting, causing a restart loop even though the app is healthy once it's had time to start. Check `pm2 logs baby-statistic-healthcheck --lines 100 --nostream` for the actual failure reason before each restart (e.g. `ECONNREFUSED`, `The operation was aborted` = timeout, or `unhealthy status 5xx`/`4xx`).

- **Boots slower than the grace period allows**: if the server takes longer than `HEALTHCHECK_GRACE_MS` (default 20s) to start listening (e.g. slow disk, many migrations on first run), raise it: set `HEALTHCHECK_GRACE_MS` higher in `ecosystem.config.js` for the `baby-statistic-healthcheck` app.
- **Slow to respond under load, not actually down**: if the log shows timeouts (`The operation was aborted`) rather than connection refusals, raise `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 8000).
- **`HEALTHCHECK_URL` / `PORT` mismatch**: if you moved the server off port 80 (see above), make sure `HEALTHCHECK_URL` in `ecosystem.config.js` points at the same port the server actually listens on.
- After changing any of these, apply with `pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env` (plain `pm2 restart` does **not** pick up new `env` values from the config file).

### `pm2 logs baby-statistic-server` shows nothing at all (not even startup lines)
This means the process is dying before its first `console.log` ever flushes, or PM2 is reading stale log files from a previous registration. Check, in order:
1. **Is the app actually running?** `pm2 status` — if restarts (`↺`) is pegged at `max_restarts` (10) and status is `errored`/`stopped`, PM2 gave up; it won't retry or log anything further until you manually restart it.
2. **Read the log files directly** (bypasses `pm2 logs`' tailing/buffering): `pm2 describe baby-statistic-server` to confirm the exact `out_file` / `error_file` paths, then `cat logs/server-error.log` and `cat logs/server-out.log` at the repo root.
3. **Confirm the build actually happened on this machine**: `ls -la dist/index.js`. If it's missing (build failed or was never run), Node exits instantly with `Cannot find module`.
4. **Stale PM2 registration**: if `ecosystem.config.js` changed (e.g. added `out_file`) but PM2 still has an old process definition saved (`pm2 save`), delete and recreate it: `pm2 delete ecosystem.config.js && pm2 start ecosystem.config.js && pm2 save`.
5. Most common root cause is still the `EACCES` port-80 case above — check that first.
